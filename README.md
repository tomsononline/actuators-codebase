# Actuators Codebase

A public collection of example files for operating various actuators—such as motors, relays, servos, and solenoids—on platforms including Arduino and STM32.

## Purpose

This repository provides simple, well-commented example files to help users integrate actuators into their projects. Each actuator folder contains wiring information, datasheet links, and example code for supported microcontroller platforms.

## Structure

- `actuators/` — Each actuator has its own folder, with example code for different platforms (`arduino/`, `stm32/`, etc.) and a `notes.md` for wiring and usage.
- `docs/` — Documentation and contribution guidelines.

## How to Use

1. Browse to the actuator you’re interested in (`actuators/ActuatorName/`).
2. Pick your platform (`arduino/`, `stm32/`, etc.).
3. Review and follow the wiring and setup notes in `notes.md`.
4. Use or adapt the example files in your own projects.

## Supported Actuators

See [`docs/ACTUATORS.md`](docs/ACTUATORS.md) for a full list of supported actuators and platforms.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [`docs/Contributing.md`](docs/Contributing.md) for guidelines on adding new actuators or improving existing examples.
